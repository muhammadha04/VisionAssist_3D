### Key Features

- **3D Object Detection**: Automatically detects and overlays 3D models on physical objects using Azure Object Anchors, offering a seamless AR experience.
- **Navigational Aids**: Provides dynamic AR overlays to guide users through indoor environments, enhancing spatial awareness.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Collects data on users' movements and eye gazes to analyze and improve the application's effectiveness.

### Goals

Our project is centered around the exploration of augmented reality's potential in improving life quality for individuals with low vision, focusing on:

- Enhancing spatial awareness and object recognition through AR.
- Evaluating the impact of AR annotations on navigation in various environments.

### Technical Overview

VisionAssist integrates several cutting-edge technologies:

- **Microsoft HoloLens 2**: A leading mixed reality headset providing an immersive AR experience.
- **Azure Object Anchors (AOA)**: Allows for accurate 3D object recognition and tracking without the need for physical markers.
- **Polycam App**: Utilized for capturing images and transforming them into raw 3D models for further refinement and use within the app.
